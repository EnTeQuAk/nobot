Installation
------------

#. Install or add ``nobot`` to your Python path.

#. Add ``nobot`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting.

#. Add a ``NOBOT_RECAPTCHA_PUBLIC_KEY`` setting to the project's ``settings.py`` file. This is your public API key as provided by reCAPTCHA, i.e.::

    NOBOT_RECAPTCHA_PUBLIC_KEY = '76wtgdfsjhsydt7r5FFGFhgsdfytd656sad75fgh'

   This can be seperately specified at runtime by passing a ``public_key`` parameter when constructing the ``ReCaptchaField``, see field usage below.

#. Add a ``NOBOT_RECAPTCHA_PRIVATE_KEY`` setting to the project's ``settings.py`` file. This is your private API key as provided by reCAPTCHA, i.e.::

    NOBOT_RECAPTCHA_PRIVATE_KEY = '98dfg6df7g56df6gdfgdfg65JHJH656565GFGFGs'

   This can be seperately specified at runtime by passing a ``private_key`` parameter when constructing the ``ReCaptchaField``, see field usage below.


Usage
-----

Field
~~~~~

The quickest way to add reCAPTHCA to a form is to use the included ``ReCaptchaField`` field type. A ``ReCaptcha`` widget will be rendered with the field validating itself without any further action required from you. For example::

    from django import forms
    from nobot.fields import ReCaptchaField

    class FormWithCaptcha(forms.Form):
        captcha = ReCaptchaField()

The reCAPTCHA widget supports several `Javascript options variables <https://code.google.com/apis/recaptcha/docs/customization.html>`_ customizing the behaviour of the widget, such as ``theme`` and ``lang``. You can forward these options to the widget by passing an ``attr`` parameter containing a dictionary of options to ``ReCaptchaField``, i.e.::

    captcha = ReCaptchaField(attrs={'theme' : 'clean'})

The captcha client takes the key/value pairs and writes out the RecaptchaOptions value in JavaScript.
